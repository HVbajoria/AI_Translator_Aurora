## What students will learn

Have you ever wanted to incorporate artificial intelligence into a website? Do you want to be able to translate text in your web apps? With Cognitive Services and Flask you can create a website to translate text with a small amount of code.

## Workshop flow

### Setup your environment

Attendees will start by [configuring their environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app/1-exercise-set-up-environment?wt.mc_id=studentamb_189349). They will install the necessary tooling, create the folder for their project, and setup the necessary Python libraries.

### Create the app

After setting up the environment, attendees will [create the project](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app/3-exercise-create-app?wt.mc_id=studentamb_189349). They will create the template for the landing page and test their application is running correctly.

### Create the Translator service

Once the project is up and running, the attendee will [create the necessary services on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app/5-exercise-create-translator-service?wt.mc_id=studentamb_189349). They'll obtain the necessary keys to call the service, and properly store them in a **.env** file.

### Call the service from the app

To close out the workshop, attendees will [add the code to call the Translator service](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app/6-exercise-call-translator?wt.mc_id=studentamb_189349). They'll finish by testing their application and seeing text translated in their app!
